Crypto Portfolio Proposal
This project aims to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies. The goal is to incorporate factors beyond returns and volatility to enhance the portfolio's performance. The project uses financial Python programming skills and unsupervised learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their performance in different time periods. The resulting clusters are then visualized to present the performance to the board of directors.

Files
The following files are provided for this project:

The project is divided into several sections:

Import the Data: This section involves importing the provided data in the starter code.

Prepare the Data: This section focuses on preparing the data for analysis.

Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data: In this section, the elbow method is used to find the optimal value for k, which represents the number of clusters.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data: This section involves clustering the cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm with the best value for k.

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis: This section performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data: The elbow method is applied to the PCA data to determine the best value for k.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data: Clustering of cryptocurrencies is performed using the K-means algorithm with the best value for k obtained from the PCA data.

Visualize and Compare the Results: This section involves visualizing and comparing the cluster analysis results using both the original data and the PCA data.

Please refer to the detailed instructions in the Jupyter notebook for each section.
